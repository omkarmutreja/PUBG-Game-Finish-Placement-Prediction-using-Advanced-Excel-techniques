# PUBG-Game-Finish-Placement-Prediction-using-Advanced-Excel-techniques
This repository is regarding a Data analysis and decision making project to predict the chances of winning the PUBG battle for Squad, Duo and Solo mode implemented through advanced excel concepts

## Introduction
PUBG  abbreviated as Player Unknown’s Battle Grounds
The Game : Players are dropped into a wide, open area, and they must fight to survive while the battlefield shrinks which adds more pressure. Killing the competition, increases player survival and  a chance to loot the gear from a dead player.
Game Channels : Smart Phone App & Computer
Fun Facts : 5th  Best selling game of all time with over millions of active monthly users  

## Excel Techniques: Data Analysis Toolpak and Stats tool
1) Descriptive statistics and plots - Mean, median, variance, skewness, bar plots, pie charts, histograms, boxplots
2) Pivot tables and pivot charts
3) Regression - Linear and Multiple Regression Techniques
4) Forecasting 

## Objectives:
1) To explain the dataset and sampling
2) To understand the relationship between the numerical and categorical variable
2) Performing exploratory data analysis on the different variables
3) Report the key findings in terms of descriptive statistics
4) To analyse and model the best strategy to win the game using a random sample of 15000 observations
5) Evaluate significant variables affecting the Win placement of a player
6) Identify co-relation between significant variables
7) Interpret and evaluate the final regression model
8) Forecast and predict the values
9) Check RMSE and MAD

## Conclusion:
1) On average a player uses 3.7 weapons in a single game & 83% of the players acquire more than 1 weapon
2) If a player kills 7 enemies in a match, the player has already exceeded 99% of other players
3) On average a player walks 1250 meters and rides 768 meters in a squad battle which is the highest compared to Duo and Solo battles
4) 72% of the players use less than 1 Boost item & 57% of the players didn’t use any Boost item
5) 76% of the players use less than 1 Heal item & 62% of the players didn’t use any Heal item
6) Model 3 is the best model with dummy and interaction variables for predicting the WinPlacePercentage (Adjusted R square – 0.7313)
7) The most significant predictors are assists, kills, weapons Acquired, Walk Distance 
and Match type
8) The final RMSE of the model is 15.95 and MAD is 12.32

Players all over the world can study this model and focus on the important elements of the game to improve their chances of winning ( Important elements – Significant Predictors)
